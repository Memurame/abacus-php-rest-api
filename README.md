# Abacus PHP REST API
This repository addresses the [Abacus REST API](https://apihub.abacus.ch/) and thus simplifies the handling of requests.
This was developed by me for my own purposes.
You are also welcome to use it yourself and help develop it further.

**This repository is still in its infancy.
It will therefore not yet have many functions.**
